# Simple Notebook App in Python

This is a simple notebook application built in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It was created as my first Python project when I was at a beginner level of Python programming. The aim of this project was to practice fundamental concepts such as GUI development, file handling, and basic data manipulation.

## Features

- **Create Note**: Users can create a new note by providing text content and optionally setting a deadline.
- **View Notes**: All existing notes are displayed in a list for easy access.
- **Delete Note**: Users can delete a note from the list.
- **Date Selection**: Option to select a deadline for a note using a calendar widget.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
